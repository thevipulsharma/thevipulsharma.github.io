# Movies

I am a great fan of good movies, and like to watch one whenever I get some free time apart from the
usual necessities. It all started in the second semester of my college, when I was hunting the world
for things I wanted to do. And, at some point I stumbled with this amazing non-real world and the story
have been happily non-ending since then...
