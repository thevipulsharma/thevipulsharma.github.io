# Movies
I watch a lot of movies :tv:. I averaged 4 movies a week for over 2 years.

## What kind of movies I like?
Good ones

## How did I got into this?
Well, in 2nd semester of my college [Credits: Gagan Bansal] and I was all over in it.

## How about TV Series?
I've watched some, Friends is my favourite. But, otherwise I think of it as a total waste of time.
